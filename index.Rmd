Hi! My name is Louis Sharp, I'm from Oakland, CA and I am in the MS in Biostatistics program at Columbia University in New York, studying Public Health Data Science! I did my Bachelor's studies at University of California, Berkeley in Molecular and Cell Biology. Some of my interests include science (biological and otherwise), kitties, motorcycles, and cooking.
